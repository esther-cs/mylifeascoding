You'll find all my programming projects here. I hope you enjoy them!

### Programming Languages
I know how to code with Python, C++, C and JavaScript (beginner in JavaScript), HTML and Bash (a bit of it).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/esther-cs/mylifeascoding/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
